a sandbox sort of area to mock out some dev environments

## frontend
 a node dev environment
 just replace the the package.json in the src folder with yours 

 or once the container is spun up. delete package.json and then
 use your own project creation process. ie. create-react-app vue cli or vite ...

 then

``` 
npm run dev -- --host --port 3000

```

or what is appropriate for what you chose

## backend

a python dev environment. just replace src files with your own files

### Pause and Branch

This should do it for the main branch for now.

basic scaffolding in place for a Python app/webapp development

basic scaffolding for a js front end development

Check branches tags and releases

### silly edit to see git graph split - this one on main
